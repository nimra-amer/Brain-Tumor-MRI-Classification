This project was developed in collaboration with a team member as part of the Data Mining course. The goal was to classify MRI images to detect the presence of brain tumors using various machine learning techniques.

Features:

1)Data Preprocessing: Handled MRI image data from Kaggle, including normalization and augmentation, to improve model performance.

2)Model Training: Implemented Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Logistic Regression, and the pre-trained VGG-19 model to classify brain tumors.

3)Class Imbalance Handling: Applied techniques to address class imbalance, ensuring accurate and reliable classification results.

4)Evaluation and Comparison: Assessed and compared model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to determine the best model.

Project Highlights:
1)Collaborative Effort: Developed in collaboration with [Team Member's Name].

2)Comprehensive Analysis: Included a detailed comparison of CNN, Logistic Regression, and VGG-19 models.

3)Practical Application: Demonstrated practical data mining and machine learning techniques in the medical field.
