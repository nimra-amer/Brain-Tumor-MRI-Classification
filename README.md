# Brain-Tumor-MRI-Classification
This project was developed in collaboration with a team member as part of the Data Mining course. The goal was to classify MRI images to detect the presence of brain tumors using various machine learning techniques.

Features
Data Preprocessing: Handled MRI image data from Kaggle, including normalization and augmentation, to improve model performance.
Model Training: Implemented Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Logistic Regression, and the pre-trained VGG-19 model to classify brain tumors.
Class Imbalance Handling: Applied techniques to address class imbalance, ensuring accurate and reliable classification results.
Evaluation and Comparison: Assessed and compared model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to determine the best model.
Project Highlights
Collaborative Effort: Developed in collaboration with [Team Member's Name].
Comprehensive Analysis: Included a detailed comparison of CNN, Logistic Regression, and VGG-19 models.
Practical Application: Demonstrated practical data mining and machine learning techniques in the medical field.
